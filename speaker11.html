                    Raffaele Scuderi received his master degree (summa cum laude) in Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Pisa, Italy, in 2010. After he graduated, he joined the Microwave and Radiation Laboratory of the University 
                    of Pisa as Ph.D. student. During this period, his research activity was focused on the numerical solution of Maxwell equations with special attention to the development of equivalent radiation models for EMC problems. In 2011, he has been visiting student at the department of Electrical Engineering of the Pennsylvania State University. In 2012 he joined IDS –Ingegneria Dei Sistemi as System Analyst and then as Application Engineer. His job was focused on simulation and measurements of the electromagnetic phenomena for complex platforms (radiation and scattering), in the radio frequency and infrared spectrum. In 2018 he joined Dassault Systèmes and his current role is Electromagnetics Industry Process Consultant. He works in the field of the electromagnetic simulation as SIMULIA EMAG specialist, 
                    contributing into the pre/post-sales activities, consulting services and R&D. Raffaele actively contributes to the scientific community publishing articles and holding lectures and seminars on electromagnetic simulation.

Industry 4.0 and digitalization of the factory promises enormous benefits in terms of efficiency, 
productivity and sustainability. 5G private networks will be able to provide the required networking 
performance, and initial industrial deployments are showing promise. <br><br>
But modern factories or assembly halls are complex environments. Planning robust wireless connections 
in the smart factory relies on an understanding of coverage and individual channel responses. Ray 
tracing based simulation has an important role to play in predicting this behavior, complementing costly 
and time consuming measurement campaigns exercises in existing realistic real-world environments, and 
predicting performance in planned facilities. This digital or virtual twin model of the factory environment 
can help to minimize the number of access points whilst optimizing coverage, before the factory is 
upgraded or built.  <br><br>
This presentation will describe a flexible ray-tracing based workflow for analyzing coverage and 
communication channels in such a complex and dynamic environment, using SIMULIA CST Studio Suite ® 
and the 3DEXPERIENCE ® platform. Topics will include: <br> - preparation of realistic 3D factory models with moving elements for simulation,<br>  - impact of antenna positioning on the channel prediction, and <br> - simulation of the scenario to predict coverage and the channel response.
