                   The talk covers recent advances in Signal Processing and Communication. The potential application areas of these two important aspects of Electronics will also be presented.
                    The talk will deal fixed, adaptive, intelligent and distributed signal processing techniques.
                     The various application areas will include: bio-medical engineering, active noise control, hearing aid, natural language processing, intelligent sensors, 
                     compressive sensing etc. In the field of communication, sensor networks, cognitive radio and 5G/6G communication will be presented. 
                     The recent optimization techniques will also be dealt during the course of the talk.
                    In essence, the talk will be useful to faculty members and senior students, PhD scholars and those who are interested for research work in these areas.
